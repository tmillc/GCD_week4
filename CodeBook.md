# Codebook for UCI Human Activity Recognition Dataset
## Description of Data
30 volunteers performed activities (walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting,
standing, and laying) with a Samsung Galaxy S II taking acceleration data. A total of 11880 observations were made with 561 features for the data. `run_analysis.R` tidies up the dataset and subsets the features, leaving only the means and standard deviations. 

The full list of features can be found in `UCI HAR Dataset/features.txt`, with additional information provided in `UCI HAR Dataset/features_info.txt`.
